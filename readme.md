# Social Snakes

## Objective:
A place where snakes (people who may define themselves as solitary creatures) like to meet up and chat. Hang out anytime, anywhere in one of our snake dens where you can meet up with friends or other people around the world.

Snakes can send private messages and can meet up in one of our dens. They can also give other snakes 'egg(s)'. Eggs are given as a reward to other snakes for being a valued member of the den; the more eggs you stack up, the more powerful you are.

As snakes, we are sometimes just beneath the sensory awareness of those around us, 'under the radar' so-to-speak and not even noticed. With that, it gives us the time to observe many things as we slowly slither through others' subconscious.
